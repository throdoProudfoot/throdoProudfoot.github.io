And the system doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any way to have different stats in the same weapon depending on how mane hands you use.\nYou have to find a workaround\nSetting up the system to handle weapon usable both in one-hand and two-hands It is quite easy to setup TOR for one hand/two hands weapon like spears. you have to use 2 items (one for one hand and the other for two hands) and the trick is to change the load of one of the 2 items to 0 in the character sheet.\n  Note The best way is to change the load of the item in the sheet as Foundry VTT does copy of the item when you drop the item in a sheet so the original item is not updated. This way you always the right stat for the reference item and you only change the instance of the item in the sheet.\nConclusion To have a really neat and clean way to handle this feature in TOR would mean a lot of code and complexity, it would be over engineering to do it so I chose not to do so and use this workaround.\n","description":"","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":["tor2e-system","tutorials","tipsntricks","pcs"],"title":"How to setup 1-hand and 2-hands weapons","uri":"https://outme.hervedarritchon.fr/en/posts/foundryvtt/tor2e/one-hand-two-hands-weapons/"},{"content":"Lots of systems, having an item (magical or not) can modify the characteristics of a Hero or an Adversary. In Foundry VTT, it is possible to have this automation using Active Effect. In this article I will show you how to automate the modification of the Piercing Blow modification using a keen Weapon (Reward).\nI will tell you how to do it, how it is working and also what is the limitation (TOR2e system).\nAttacking with a standard simple weapon With this weapon, no active effect, you can see that the piercing blow threshold is 10 (which is the standard value). No modification at all whatsoever.\n  With a standard weapon equipped, the system will try to beat 10 on the feat die to trigger a piercing blow.\nAttacking with a keen weapon A keen weapon (one of the reward available to player in the Core Rules), this weapon has a special capacity, it triggers a piercing blow on a 9+ (9, 10 and Gandalf Rune for Character and Sauron Eye for Adversary) instead of 10.\n  With a keen weapon equipped (a weapon with an active effect keen), the system will try to beat 9 on the feat die to trigger a piercing blow.\nBut \u0026hellip; How to create such Active Effect in Tor2e ? (please read next paragraph).\nHow to create a keen Active Effect In the video below, you can see how to create such active effect but before, you have to know a few things about active effect and Foundry VTT.\nNote First of all, you have to add the active effect on an item in the Item Sidebar, you can\u0026rsquo;t modify an active effect in an item embedded in an actor (actor is the FVTT term for characters, adversaries, npcs, \u0026hellip;).\nSecondly, please notice, active effect are not items you can drag\u0026rsquo;n drop on an item/actor, you need to add it using the active effect tab in an item sheet.\nAdd an active effect to the item So to add an active effect, you need to go to the sidebar and open the item sheet you want to modify, then you go to the active effect tab in the sheet. In the active effect tab, you have to click on the \u0026quot;+\u0026quot; on the sheet.\nA customization popup appears on the screen to set up the active effect data. You will have to fill some of the fields to make it work !\nImportant To have an active effect active in your sheet, you need to uncheck the \u0026ldquo;Effect Suspended\u0026rdquo; checkbox. If you forget to uncheck this checkbox, that active effect will have NO EFFECT in your actor !\nIn fact, this checkbox is used by FVTT to know the effect should be suspended (so not active) or if it should be actve (this is what we want). This is mainly the source of error and mistake when you create your active effect, it is not working.\nOften You forgot to modify the checkbox so it is doing nothing !\nCreate an effect in the Active Effect Once, the item has an active effect and this active effect is not suspended (so it is active), you need to create an effect. To do so, go to the Effects tab and add an effect using \u0026quot;+\u0026quot; icon. The effect has some data to specify (Attribute Key to modify, Method of modification and Value).\nFor our keen Active Effect purpose, you need to choose :\n Attribute Key \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Weapon Piercing Blow Change Method \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Downgrade Value \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 9    Now if you test, you should have the expected result, triggering a piercing blow on 9. But if you look closely, you can see a little issue (see below for explanation).\nCurrent Tor2e System limitations If you look at the video until the end, you will notice that if you have an item with a keen active effect, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t attack with the weapon, or you even don\u0026rsquo;t have the item equipped, the piercing blow threshold is downgrade to 9 which is wrong ! The system shouldn\u0026rsquo;t modify the piercing blow threshold.\nI have a solution to do it correctly, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t coded it yet so \u0026hellip; for now, you need to modify the sheet, deleting the item or keep in mind and compute the proper value of the threshold in your head.\n  Conclusion To create a keen Active Effect, you have to keep in mind [how to do it correctly](#keen-active-effec and to know some [limitations](#navigating-between-input-fields of the system.\nWalking through the active system attribute key list, you notice there is some attribute you can change, I also will add new later on. You can play with all the attributes but keep in mind it is a WIP feature that will evolve and it is not perfect.\n","description":"","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":["tor2e-system","tutorials","tipsntricks"],"title":"Active Effect for Piercing Blow","uri":"https://outme.hervedarritchon.fr/en/posts/foundryvtt/tor2e/active-effects/keen-active-effect/"},{"content":"Developing a system for a TTRPG is sometimes complicated because you have to make some choice because there are as many opinions as there are people playing :) And sometimes, opinions are opposite. So I try to make the system the less opinionated to let people use it and play as they want, but there are some limits.\nFor this first post, I will show you some keyboard keys you can use to ease your life. I have made a short video to show you how to do it, in the bottom of the video you will see the keyboard keys I use.\nNavigating between input fields If you need to go from one input field to the next one, you can use the tab key as it is shown in the video below.\nTip Use Tab Key to go to next field and Shit+Tab to the previous one.\n  It is fairly simple and easy to use when you want to fill quickly the value of the input field. Please keep in mind, it is very valuable with the last tips of this post about modifying numeric values with arrow keys.\nSkill value modification One of the most misunderstood feature of Tor2e, it\u0026rsquo;s how to modify the skill values (common skills, combat proficiencies, \u0026hellip;). I think it is the majority of the question we had, it is about this feature !\n - How the hell am I modifying the skill value in the sheet ?\n- There is a bug, I can\u0026rsquo;t change the value of my sheet !\n Well in fact, bugs can happen, I had experienced a lot, I am sorry about that, but it is part of the job of coding ;) But there is no bug with the modification of the skill value :\nTip You HAVE to use the Alt Key to add one (+1) to the skill value and as a contrary Shift + Alt Click to decrease one (-1) to the skill value.\nYou can have a look at the video below to see an example of \u0026ldquo;How to modify the skill values of a character sheet\u0026rdquo;.\n  Why did you do that It is quite simple, character sheet should not be modified by miss click or by error, so I needed to find a solution, this one seems to be the best for me and for my players. I should have made another decision \u0026hellip; but you know \u0026hellip; if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case, I won\u0026rsquo;t be here writing about that so \u0026hellip; It is made this way and I tried to do so all over the sheets. So if you want to toggle a state (weary, miserable), you have to do the same.\nModifying numeric input fields Last tips of the post, but not the least, because I think the most unknown ! It is about modifying numeric value using arrow keys (up and down). For all numeric input field, you use up arrow to add 1 and down arrow to decrease 1 from the current value. It is very straight forward and very useful if you use it with the first tip about navigating between input fields.\nTip Use Up key to add 1 and Down key to decrease 1.\nPlease look at the video below to see an example of how to use that in the System.\n  Cherry on the Cake If you use the up and down key, you will notice that the value of the field is limited top and bottom with a value I have set up in the system. This way you won\u0026rsquo;t fill the input field with a wrong value. It is very convenient and avoid to type wrong value.\nEven if you type a wrong value (not an integer for example), there is a tick and a cross to tell you if the value is \u0026ldquo;ok\u0026rdquo; or not for the system.\nConclusion I wanted for a while to share with 3 these 3 tips, because one is the most misunderstood and one is the most unknown :) I hope it will help you !\nUse these 3 tips to easy your life using the system and have more times to enjoy and roleplay.\nTake in this hard time and stay in touch for more news.\n","description":"","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":["tor2e-system","tips-n-tricks"],"title":"Keyboard Usage","uri":"https://outme.hervedarritchon.fr/en/posts/foundryvtt/tor2e/keyboard-usage/"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Very best wishes for Yule - J.

Tolkien, himself ! In this period of holidays and end of year, called Yule in Middle-Earth, I decided to start a blog to share the little I know if it helps, a small gift to Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s work.\nJust a few words about me, I am a Table Top Role Player since the 80s, I have 3 children and a Wife, and I am a professional developer. Saying that, I said nothing important but combining all together and thanks to the lockdown, last year I started as a hobby a project (it\u0026rsquo;s nearly the first anniversary of the project) to integrate \u0026ldquo;The One Ring\u0026rdquo; (v1) for Foundry VTT.\nAt first, it was the v1 of the TTRPG (now it is ended) then the v2 (The One Ring TTRPG) after the Kickstarter.\nAfter nearly one year of coding, chatting with the community, role-playing with friends, I think it\u0026rsquo;s time to aggregate some of my experience somewhere. People often ask me the same questions about The One Ring or the System I have done for FVTT, so it will be the place to put all the answers, all the reflexions I have, ideas, \u0026hellip;\nPlease take a sit, get some drink and meet me elsewhere on this blog to talk of Tolkien, Middle-Earth or TTRPG ;)\nI wish you all the very best for Yule !\n","description":"","id":4,"section":"posts","tags":["Blog","Mood"],"title":"Very best wishes for Yule","uri":"https://outme.hervedarritchon.fr/en/posts/very-best-wishes-for-yule/"}]
