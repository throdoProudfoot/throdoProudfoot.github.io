[{"content":"Developing a system for a TTRPG is sometimes complicated because you have to make some choice because there are as many opinions as there are people playing :) And sometimes, opinions are opposite. So I try to make the system the less opinionated to let people use it and play as they want, but there are some limits.\nFor this first post, I will show you some keyboard keys you can use to ease your life. I have made a short video to show you how to do it, in the bottom of the video you will see the keyboard keys I use.\nNavigating between input fields If you need to go from one input field to the next one, you can use the tab key as it is shown in the video below.\nTip Use Tab Key to go to next field and Shit+Tab to the previous one.\n  It is fairly simple and easy to use when you want to fill quickly the value of the input field. Please keep in mind, it is very valuable with the last tips of this post about modifying numeric values with arrow keys.\nSkill value modification One of the most misunderstood feature of Tor2e, it\u0026rsquo;s how to modify the skill values (common skills, combat proficiencies, \u0026hellip;). I think it is the majority of the question we had, it is about this feature !\n - How the hell am I modifying the skill value in the sheet ?\n- There is a bug, I can\u0026rsquo;t change the value of my sheet !\n Well in fact, bugs can happen, I had experienced a lot, I am sorry about that, but it is part of the job of coding ;) But there is no bug with the modification of the skill value :\nTip You HAVE to use the Alt Key to add one (+1) to the skill value and as a contrary Shift + Alt Click to decrease one (-1) to the skill value.\nYou can have a look at the video below to see an example of \u0026ldquo;How to modify the skill values of a character sheet\u0026rdquo;.\n  Why did you do that It is quite simple, character sheet should not be modified by miss click or by error, so I needed to find a solution, this one seems to be the best for me and for my players. I should have made another decision \u0026hellip; but you know \u0026hellip; if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case, I won\u0026rsquo;t be here writing about that so \u0026hellip; It is made this way and I tried to do so all over the sheets. So if you want to toggle a state (weary, miserable), you have to do the same.\nModifying numeric input fields Last tips of the post, but not the least, because I think the most unknown ! It is about modifying numeric value using arrow keys (up and down). For all numeric input field, you use up arrow to add 1 and down arrow to decrease 1 from the current value. It is very straight forward and very useful if you use it with the first tip about navigating between input fields.\nTip Use Up key to add 1 and Down key to decrease 1.\nPlease look at the video below to see an example of how to use that in the System.\n  Cherry on the Cake If you use the up and down key, you will notice that the value of the field is limited top and bottom with a value I have set up in the system. This way you won\u0026rsquo;t fill the input field with a wrong value. It is very convenient and avoid to type wrong value.\nEven if you type a wrong value (not an integer for example), there is a tick and a cross to tell you if the value is \u0026ldquo;ok\u0026rdquo; or not for the system.\nConclusion I wanted for a while to share with 3 these 3 tips, because one is the most misunderstood and one is the most unknown :) I hope it will help you !\nUse these 3 tips to easy your life using the system and have more times to enjoy and roleplay.\nTake in this hard time and stay in touch for more news.\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["tor2e-system","tips-n-tricks"],"title":"Keyboard Usage","uri":"https://outme.hervedarritchon.fr/en/posts/keyboard-usage/"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Very best wishes for Yule - J. R. R. Tolkien\u0026rdquo; â€• Tolkien to Richard Jeffery in Letter 347, (dated 17 December 1972)\n How to start a blog on Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s Legacy in a better way than quoting J.R.R. Tolkien, himself ! In this period of holidays and end of year, called Yule in Middle-Earth, I decided to start a blog to share the little I know if it helps, a small gift to Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s work.\nJust a few words about me, I am a Table Top Role Player since the 80s, I have 3 children and a Wife, and I am a professional developer. Saying that, I said nothing important but combining all together and thanks to the lockdown, last year I started as a hobby a project (it\u0026rsquo;s nearly the first anniversary of the project) to integrate \u0026ldquo;The One Ring\u0026rdquo; (v1) for Foundry VTT.\nAt first, it was the v1 of the TTRPG (now it is ended) then the v2 (The One Ring TTRPG) after the Kickstarter.\nAfter nearly one year of coding, chatting with the community, role-playing with friends, I think it\u0026rsquo;s time to aggregate some of my experience somewhere. People often ask me the same questions about The One Ring or the System I have done for FVTT, so it will be the place to put all the answers, all the reflexions I have, ideas, \u0026hellip;\nPlease take a sit, get some drink and meet me elsewhere on this blog to talk of Tolkien, Middle-Earth or TTRPG ;)\nI wish you all the very best for Yule !\n","description":"","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":["Blog","Mood"],"title":"Very best wishes for Yule","uri":"https://outme.hervedarritchon.fr/en/posts/very-best-wishes-for-yule/"}]
