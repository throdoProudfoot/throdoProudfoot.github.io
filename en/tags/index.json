[{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Very best wishes for Yule - J. R. R. Tolkien\u0026rdquo; â€• Tolkien to Richard Jeffery in Letter 347, (dated 17 December 1972)\n How to start a blog on Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s Legacy in a better way than quoting J.R.R. Tolkien, himself ! In this period of holidays and end of year, called Yule in Middle-Earth, I decided to start a blog to share the little I know if it helps, a small gift to Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s work.\nJust a few words about me, I am a Table Top Role Player since the 80s, I have 3 children and a Wife, and I am a professional developer. Saying that, I said nothing important but combining all together and thanks to the lockdown, last year I started as a hobby a project (it\u0026rsquo;s nearly the first anniversary of the project) to integrate \u0026ldquo;The One Ring\u0026rdquo; (v1) for Foundry VTT.\nAt first, it was the v1 of the TTRPG (now it is ended) then the v2 (The One Ring TTRPG) after the Kickstarter.\nAfter nearly one year of coding, chatting with the community, role-playing with friends, I think it\u0026rsquo;s time to aggregate some of my experience somewhere. People often ask me the same questions about The One Ring or the System I have done for FVTT, so it will be the place to put all the answers, all the reflexions I have, ideas, \u0026hellip;\nPlease take a sit, get some drink and meet me elsewhere on this blog to talk of Tolkien, Middle-Earth or TTRPG ;)\nI wish you all the very best for Yule !\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["Blog","Mood"],"title":"Very best wishes for Yule","uri":"http://outme.hervedarritchon.fr/en/posts/very-best-wishes-for-yule/"}]
